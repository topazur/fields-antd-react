> 24 Grids System.

## Import

```tsx
import { Row, Col } from '@odinlin/fields-antd-react/__builtins__/widgets';
```

### Remarks

> Code implementation reference [antd.Grid](https://ant.design/components/grid)
> - The difference is responsive design, which first calculates the specific value under the current breakpoint, and then changes the class name or style.
